### movie-recommendation

I have tried to build a Movie Recommendation Engine using Cosine Based Similarity Algorithm.

Regarding the dataset, it has 3 features - userid, movie name and ratings given by user for each movie. The userid is a replacement for user names which are unique with each other.
